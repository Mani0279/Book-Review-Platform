Backend Overview (Typical) 
The backend is commonly built using Node.js with Express framework, providing RESTful APIs for:

User authentication and authorization (sign up, login, session management)

CRUD operations for books and user reviews

Managing user-specific reading lists

Integrating with external book data APIs (like Google Books API) to fetch book metadata

Persisting data using MongoDB or similar NoSQL databases for flexible schema

Handling ratings and comments with data models designed for fast queries

This setup enables secure, scalable, and responsive interactions between the frontend and the data layer.
